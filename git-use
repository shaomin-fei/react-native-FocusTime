1. bind local to remote
git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>
if you want all your branches to use this remote repo, use following command
git push --all --set-upstream origin

2.install android studio
use this tool to do emulator job

3. install yarn
React native recommend us to use yarn to manage packages
npm install -g yarn
after installation, when run yarn, report error like " cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this
system.", then we need execute command like:(notice ,use administrator priority to run power shell)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

4. isntall expo-cli
yarn add expo-cli --global
after install, run yarn start will run expo locally

or, run yarn android to run on emulator, but you may suffer from error like "No Android connected device found, and no emulators could be started automatically.
Please connect a device or create an emulator (https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator)"
you need to have the Android emulator opened, then you can open the project on it.
